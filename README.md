This dashboard presents an interactive analysis of 2,375 wearable health devices tested up to June 2025. It focuses on performance metrics like battery life, health accuracy, and GPS presence, enabling comparison across brands, device categories, and models.

1. General Performance Metrics (Top Cards)
   Metric	Insight to Share
   Total Devices	A total of 2,375 devices were evaluated.
   Average Battery Life	Devices have an average battery life of 160.58 hours, but brand variation is significant.
   % Devices with GPS	About 73.39% of devices have GPS, which is useful for understanding location-based health tracking.
    Avg. Performance Score	Average score across devices is 64.05, indicating room for performance optimization across the industry.

2. Device-Level Table Insights
   I chose to not summarize, allowing stakeholders to drill down to individual device performance (e.g., Amazfit Band 7 variants).
   Enables use-case-driven filtering (e.g., battery > 80 hrs, heart accuracy > 0.9, etc.).
   Supports detailed comparisons for decision-makers or product analysts.

3. Performance Metric Comparison Line Chart
    
  I visualized Heart Rate Accuracy, Step Count Accuracy, and Sleep Tracking Accuracy by brand.
  For example, Fitbit and Oura perform well in sleep tracking, while Garmin may underperform there despite strong hardware specs.
  Trend lines allow easy brand benchmarking.

4. Average Battery Life by Brand (Bar Chart)
  Garmin leads with a very high average (~655 hrs).
  Other brands like Fitbit, Oura, and WHOOP are clustered much lower.
  This could indicate Garmin’s focus on endurance-based devices, good for outdoor/sports use cases.

5. Has GPS by Category (Stacked Bar)
  Smartwatches dominate in having GPS, while Fitness Bands and Rings often lack it.
  You created a Has_GPS flag using DAX and visualized its distribution.
  Helps answer “Which form factors prioritize GPS?”

6. Category Distribution (Pie Chart)
  Smartwatches dominate the category share (~52%), followed by Fitness Bands and Trackers.
  You used this to show market focus and form-factor trends.

This Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to compare wearable health devices across brands and categories, using key metrics like battery life, GPS presence, and health tracking accuracy. I focused on clean layout, efficient filtering, and insight-driven visuals to support both strategic and operational decisions.
